Components
-----------------

The Analysis Page can be broken into the following components,
each component has a dialog menu that can be opened by clicking the relevant tab at the top of the page:

1.  Dendogram View - This view shows the results of hierarchical clustering performed on the current job for all features.
    The nodes are colored based on which input feature has the greatest difference at a particular level in the tree.

2.  Cluster View - This view shows the K-Means clustering results for the current job for all features.
    The points and hulls are colored based on their corresponding clusters.

3.  Scatter Plot - This view shows the databases in the current job plotted on the selected X and Y axis.
    The points are colored based on their corresponding clusters from the Cluster View.

4.  Parallel Coordinates Plot - This view shows the databases in the current job plotted on the selected axes.
    The lines are colored based on their corresponding clusters from the Cluster View.
